# LeafClassification
There are estimated to be nearly half a million species of plant in the world.<br/>
Classification of species has been historically problematic and often results in duplicate identifications. Automating plant recognition might have many applications, including:
- Species population tracking and preservation<br/>
- Plant-based medicinal research<br/>
- Crop and food supply management<br/>
The objective of this project is to use binary leaf images and extracted features, including shape, margin & texture, to accurately identify 99 species of plants. Leaves,
due to their volume, prevalence, and unique characteristics, are an effective means of
differentiating plant species. They also provide a fun introduction to applying techniques
that involve image-based features.<br/>
